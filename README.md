# WBS-School-Project2-Eniac-Discount-Case

## Data Science Case from WBS Coding School using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in high-end tech products, is questioning its discounting strategy. The Marketing Team is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow. The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts and loosing revenues on it. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market. Therefore they have asked the data department to analyise the influence of discounts on its revenue.

However the data have some inconsistencies. Therfore data had to be cleaned before doing the analysis. This were done in the following steps:

  - Data exploration
  - Data cleaning
  - Quality assessment

For data cleaning and analysis Pandas was used. The results of the analysis have been visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The final presentation as well as the starting data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W3famMboUaSAJcjVak0ZI4S7NdjW1FEF?usp=drive_link).
